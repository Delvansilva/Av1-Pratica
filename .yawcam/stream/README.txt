You can easily edit the appearance of your page by using the page designer. (Settings -> Edit settings... -> Stream -> Page designer...)

If you need more control over the page you can edit the HTML of the page your self by editing the template files: 

template_js.html (used by JavaScript) 
template_mjpg.html (used by MJPG)
template_wm.html (used by Windows Media)
